Open Source Software Project
===================================

As part of the course, we were required to identify an open source project and contribute to the development of it.
We as a group of two identified Memory Lifter, an open source learning software written in C#.
Our main contribution was to fix several bugs and implement certain features requested by users.

There are three branches each contains the patch and description of the contribution.
