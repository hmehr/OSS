The system does not accept answers that include accented characters like é, è, etc.
We created an extension method for string class that uses a character map to replace these characters with their standard corresponding character
before making a judgement about the correctness of the user answer.
The alternative would have been to ask user for a set of characters to be ignored on application setting, but this is not acceptable
since it might cause misuse.
We included the replacement of the input right into the mlifter_textbox where all sort of input analysis are happening.
